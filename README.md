# TS-EMO
This repository contains the source code for the “Thompson sampling efficient multiobjective optimization” (TSEMO) algorithm. 

To use TSEMO download all files contained in the repository and run the algorithm on the required test-function as shown in "TSEMO_Example"

To cite TSEMO use the following publication:
