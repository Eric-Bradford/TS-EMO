# Thompson sampling efficient multiobjective optimization
This repository contains the source code for the “Thompson sampling efficient multiobjective optimization” (TSEMO) algorithm outlined in [(Bradford et al., 2018)](#Bradford2018). The algorithm is written to optimize expensive, black-box functions involving multiple conflicting criteria by employing Gaussian process surrogates. It is often able to determine a good approximation of the true Pareto front in signficantly less iterations than genetic algorithms. To cite TSEMO use [(Bradford et al., 2018)](#Bradford2018).

## Getting started
To use TSEMO download all files contained in the repository and run the algorithm on the required test-function as shown in the example matlab file [TSEMO_Example](TSEMO_Example.m). To use the algorithm on your own functions simply copy the same format as the functions shown in the [test-function folder](/Test_functions/). The algorithm can be applied to any number of inputs and objectives. 

## Example applications
The algorithm has been successfully applied to several expensive multiobjective optimization problems:

* Determination of optimal conditions of a fully-automated chemical reactor system trading-off yield and environmental factors [(Schweidtmann et al., 2018)](#Schweidtmann2018)

* Optimization of a chemical process using a life-cycle assessment and cost simulation [(Helmdach et al., 2018)](#Helmdach2017) 

* Solvent selection for asymmetric catalysis using molecular descriptors [(Amar et al., 2019)](#Amar2019)
